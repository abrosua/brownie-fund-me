# Fund Me Smart Contract
This is my first step into the blockchain engineering.

Create a smart contract that allow user to transfer fund with minimum amount, and only allow the contract owner to withdraw the funds. The project is built using brownie.

This project includes:
1. Smart contract development
2. Deployment
3. Testing

The project is part of the [Blockchain Tutorial](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/brownie_fund_me) by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ&list=PLzRreXG8NJkK0Vuvh-cbx6KJy8t8ml2OG&index=37)
